Lets Clean Our code 

- Firstly, we should put our codes to the "src" folder. Its the industrial convention.
- Secondly, the Best practice is to separate all the component of our code in an individual file
- And put them all inside a folder known as Components

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- to Pass the function or variables to other files we gotta export the files 
- Exports are of 2 types
1. Default Export           2. Named Export

1. Default Export : - export default file_Name
2. Named Exprot : -  we use prefix export while defining the component or variable



- to use the exported file we are required to import the file 
- Imports are of 2 type

1. Default                  2. Named 

1. Default :- Default Imports are for when export is also default

    import file_Name from "src"

2. Named :- Named Imports are for when export is also Named

    import {file_name } from "src"

React is fast because the DOM manipulation is super quick because of its Virtural Dom

setState :- setState is a react Hook 
setState is basically a very special and very Powerful function which is used to rerender the UI

Whenever a state variable updates react rerenders the component

normal variables can only do changes in my console but State variable is so powerful that is can do changes in my UI also.


If i use normal variable it can update the data but won't be able to refresh the ui.

For ex:- If we try to change the name of a button using normal variable, it will be able to change the name of the button but 
it won't be able to show the button on the UI because it need a refresh to change the state of the inner Component.

To conquer this, we have a Special Hook known as UseState Hook.


UseState Behaves like a normal JS variable but it is a Special Variable which can Change the state of an Item

How React Changes the UI so fast?

Reconcilation Algorithm (React Fiber) :-

In this we have a concept of Virtual Dom
React Keeps track of virtual DOM as an Object
React doesn't touch html
Suppose We have 7 res-Cards and after using useState we are left with 3 res-Cards
React will compare the Virtaul DOM object of 7 res-Cards with 3 res-Cards and Update the UI so fast because it doesn't html.
It will do this only with the help of JS objects

React can find out the diff between the virtual doms and update the ui


reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
update
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`. Eventually results in a re-render.
