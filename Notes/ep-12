Redux is used in big application where the data is transfered or received in a very big amount

If there are a lot of Component and a lot of data is being transferred between the components and app is gone huge

Redux is not mandatory

Redux is not the part of react

Redux is not just used in React but it is mostly used in react

1. React-redux lib is a bridge betweeen react and redux. 
2. Redux toolkit

vinella redux is not used now because it need a lot of packages to install to make it work
it is a lot complicated
too much boiler plate code


Redux is a very big store which contain a lot of objects and is in a global space
Any componenet can use directly redux store

is it good to store all  the data inside the redux store
Yes it is good. it is completely fine

so it doesn't become too Big and Clumsy we use slices
Slices are the multiple small portion in the redux store

Slices keep similar type of data
for ex :- To store the information of card, we can store it in a differnt slice, and to store loggedIn user data we use different slices


Instead of creating a lot of contexts, we can create a Redux to manage state

State refers to any data that the application needs to keep track of.

The currently logged-in user.
Items in a shopping cart.
Data fetched from an API.
The current page or view the user is on
